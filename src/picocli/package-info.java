/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for the main picocli {@linkplain picocli.CommandLine command line parsing} and
 * {@link picocli.AutoComplete autocompletion} functionality.
 * <p>
 * The {@link picocli.CommandLine CommandLine} class is a one-file framework for creating Java command line
 * applications with almost zero code.
 *
 * {@code CommandLine} is in a single file, so it can be included in source form.
 * This lets users run picocli-based applications without requiring picocli as an external dependency.
