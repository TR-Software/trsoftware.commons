# Notes for upgrading to a newer GWT release

### Before upgrading
1. Read the [release notes](http://www.gwtproject.org/release-notes.html)
2. Look at the source code for [/dev/build.xml on GitHub](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt/blob/2.8.2/dev/build.xml) 
   (selecting the appropriate tag for the new release from the dropdown) to determine if any external dependencies have 
   changed (e.g. HtmlUnit, Jetty, Guava, etc.).  Look at the names of the jars in this build file.
