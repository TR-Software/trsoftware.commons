This package contains various implementations of CodingDictionary, which
is a way to canonicalize text tokens from their String representation, to enable
various degrees of memory savings.

Here's a list of the implementations ranked from least memory-efficient to most memory efficient
(when used in a MarkovChain trained on a fairly large corpus)

- IdentityCodingDictionary: simply returns the original String instances.
- FlyweightCodingDictionary: similar to String.intern
- *HashArrayCodingDictionary*: turns a String into a canonical number representation
- *ArrayCodingDictionary*: turns a String into a canonical number representation but doesn't use a hash map to speed up lookups

This experiment turned out to be a relative flop - the space savings don't really
justify the complexity of using a CodingDictionary.  Storing the String tokens
directly in the MarkovChain is almost just as good.  Therefore, this package
may be deleted at a later time, unless you want to construct a huge MarkovChain
and memory is a big consideration.
