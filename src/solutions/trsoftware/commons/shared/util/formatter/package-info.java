/**
 * This package is an <b>unfinished</b> work-in-progress to implement a GWT-compatible version of
 * {@link java.util.Formatter}.
 * <p>
 * It contains copies of all the Formatter-related classes from {@link java.util},
 * downloaded from the <a href="https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes">
 * OpenJDK Mercurial repo for jdk8</a>.
 * <p>
 * The goal of this project is to modify {@link solutions.trsoftware.commons.shared.util.formatter.Formatter}
 * for GWT compatibility, supporting at least a subset of its original functionality.
 *
 * <p style="color: #0073BF; font-weight: bold;">
 *   TODO: either finish this project or get rid of this package
 * </p>
 *
 * @see java.util.Formatter
