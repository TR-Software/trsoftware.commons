A state in a MarkovChain is a set of tokens from the natural language being modeled
and a probabilistic transition table for the possible next tokens.

The various implementations of State support various ways of representing language
tokens: StringState subclasses support representing tokens as Strings and
the ShortState sublcasses support short integers as tokens.  The latter
is optimized for minimal memory usage when representing large MarkovChains.

Note: the benefits of supporting string representations didn't prove to be that
great (see docs for the markovchain.dict package in package.html).  Therefore,
in the future, can delete everything but NgramStringState.
