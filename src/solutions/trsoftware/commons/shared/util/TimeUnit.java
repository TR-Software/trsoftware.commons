/**
 * A GWT-friendly, simplified, version of {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit}.
 *
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     starting with Java 1.8, there's a better implementation of this concept available in the standard library:
 *     {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit}, but that's not currently available in GWT (as of GWT 2.8.2)
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     units greater than {@link #WEEKS} are not well-defined (their values depend on the calendar being used),
 *     so we define their durations based on the approximation of 365.2425 days per year
 *     (same as {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit}); for an in-depth explanation of this topic see the linked article
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
